# ⚕️ Heart Disease Classification
## Project Overview
* Created a tool that predicts (with an accuracy ~ 84.46%) if someone has heart disease to help medical professionals diagnose potential dangers based on a patient's clinical parameters.
* Trained models on a sample of 242 patient records and tested them on a testing set of 61 records.
* Experimented with LogisticRegression, KNeighborsClassifier and RandomForestClassifier. Based on baseline models, optimizations were done for LogisticRegression and RandomForestClassifier using RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV in order to reach the best model.
## Code and Resources Used
* **Python Version**: 3.8.8
